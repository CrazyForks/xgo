# Cause of `error not instrumented by xgo`
When mock setup fails:
```go
package main

import "third.party/pkg"

func TestThirdPackage(t *testing.T){
    mock.Patch(pkg.DoSomething, func() string{
        return "mock"
    })
}
```

With the following msg:
```
func not instrumented by xgo,...
```

It means there is not trap point inserted by xgo, either because the package is not in main module, or there is some inherent limitation.

For generic function and methods, xgo cannot instrument them in go1.18 and go1.19, generic in these two versions are implemented in closure, which is implicitly generated by the compiler.

# How to solve?
By default xgo will only insert trap for packages of main module, which is resolved by `go list ./...`.

Packages not trapped by xgo cannot be mocked, the setup naturally fails.

To add extra packages for trapping, you can specify `--trap pkg`:
```sh
xgo test --trap third.party/pkg <remaining args...>
```

To add more packages, repeat this option multiple times.
